## ‚ú® Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Declarative configuration** of agents, kernels, and processes
- ü§ù **Pluggable communication protocols** (e.g. [A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A))
- üß† **Hosted and remote agent execution** via kernel-driven logic
- üîÅ **Process convergence and synthesis logic** for multi-agent workflows
- üì¶ Designed for integration in ASP.NET Core and other .NET environments

---

## üìÇ Structure

The runtime interprets a declarative component manifest (in YAML or JSON), defining:

- **Kernels** ‚Äî underlying reasoning engines (e.g. Azure OpenAI, OpenAI)
- **KernelFunctions** ‚Äî reusable prompt/function templates executable by kernels
- **Authentications** ‚Äî credentials and authorization details used to access external services
- **Toolsets** ‚Äî collections of tools that agents can invoke at runtime
- **Memories** ‚Äî external or local memory providers used to persist or retrieve contextual data
- **Agents** ‚Äî hosted or remote capabilities, built atop kernels
- **Processes** ‚Äî orchestration of agents through convergence/synthesis strategies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Runtime Component Example

Below is an example structure used by the runtime to define an application:

```yaml
components:
  kernels:
    openai:
      reasoning:
        provider: openai
        model: gpt-4o
  agents:

        description: A general-purpose assistant capable of performing a wide range of reasoning, generation, and analysis tasks
        instructions: >
          You are an advanced AI assistant.

          Your purpose is to provide high-quality, context-aware responses to a wide variety of prompts. You may be asked to:
          - Answer questions accurately and clearly
          - Generate or edit structured and unstructured text
          - Analyze input for correctness, clarity, or quality
          - Help decompose or synthesize information
          - Assist with reasoning, summarization, or evaluation
          
          Always respond with clarity, precision, and relevance. If the prompt is ambiguous or lacks sufficient context, respond by asking for clarification.
          
          You are expected to behave in a neutral, helpful, and objective manner at all times.

                  You are a task planner responsible for distributing a complex instruction to multiple specialized agents.

                  Your task:
                  1. Carefully analyze the user's original prompt.
                  2. Determine how each agent listed below (based on name and description) can contribute meaningfully.
                  3. For each agent, generate a standalone subprompt tailored to their specific function.
                  4. Each subprompt must:
                     - Be fully self-contained.
                     - Include all necessary context, including a restatement of the original user prompt.
                     - Be phrased as a direct and actionable instruction for that specific agent.
                     - Not assume the agent has access to any external context.

                  **Original User Prompt:**
                  {{ $prompt }}
                  
                  ---
                  
                  **Available Agents:**
                  {{ $agents }}
                  
                  ---
                  
                  **Output Instructions:**
                  - Return only a raw, unformatted JSON object as your full output.
                    - Do NOT wrap the JSON in triple backticks (```).
                    - Do NOT add any explanation, comment, or formatting.
                    - Do NOT prepend or append any extra text.
                    - Your response MUST be a plain JSON object only ‚Äî nothing else.
                  - Use the agent names as keys.
                  - Use the generated subprompts as values.
                  - Do **not** include any explanation, markdown, or formatting around the JSON.

                  You are an expert synthesizer responsible for combining multiple specialized insights into a single, cohesive response.

                  Your task:
                  1. Read the responses provided by various specialized agents.
                  2. Understand each response‚Äôs purpose and point of view based on the agent‚Äôs role.
                  3. Synthesize their content into a single, well-structured and informative answer.
                  4. Ensure that the final output is clear, non-redundant, and preserves all relevant contributions from each agent.

                  **Instructions:**
                  - Do not copy responses verbatim ‚Äî blend them naturally into a single narrative.
                  - Do not refer to the agents by name.
                  - The final output should sound as if written by a single, knowledgeable expert.
